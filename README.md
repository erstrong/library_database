# Academic Library Database
## Final project for INFO 6210

Partner: Shawn Kilpatrick

Purpose: The purpose of this database is to maintain the data used to generate and support school library operations. It will be used in all its features by library staff, with limited access for patrons such as searching titles and authors as well as course reserves lists and placing holds.

* ES_DraftCode.sql - this is all of the SQL I wrote for the project.
* MissionStatement&Objectives.docx - this is the initial list of objectives for the database
